> **Navigation**: [← Part 2: Python Study Buddy](part2-study-buddy.md) | [Back to Overview](README.md)

## Overview

In this part, you'll build an AI Research Learning Hub that demonstrates core MCP server capabilities through a clean, minimal implementation. This project showcases how to create tools that work together, manage simple data storage, and prepare for integration with external MCP servers.

## Key Learning Objectives

1. **MCP Server Architecture** - Design tools that work together in a cohesive workflow
2. **Simple Data Management** - Use JSON storage for research tracking and organization
3. **External MCP Integration** - Prepare users for Hugging Face and GitHub MCP server usage
4. **Workflow Design** - Create guided research processes with multiple complementary tools
5. **Resource Exposure** - Make internal data accessible to AI assistants

## Project Setup and Architecture

### Project Structure

Your completed project will have this structure:

```text
AIResearchHub/
├── server.py                    # Main MCP server implementation
├── paper_manager.py             # JSON-based data management
└── data/
    └── research_papers.json    # Local research database
```

### Essential Dependencies

Create your Python environment and install dependencies:

1. `uv venv` - Create a virtual environment  
2. `source .venv/bin/activate` - Activate the environment (macOS/Linux) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
3. `uv sync` - Install required packages from `pyproject.toml`

> **Note**: The project uses `fastmcp>=2.10.5` and `mcp[cli]>=1.9.4` as core dependencies.

### Configure MCP Integration

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` to enable the MCP servers you'll need:

```json
{
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
        "huggingface": {
            "url": "https://huggingface.co/mcp",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_BEARER_TOKEN"
            }
        },
        "github": {
            "type": "http", 
            "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
        },
        "ai-research-hub": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "server"],
            "cwd": "./AIResearchHub",
            "env": {}
        }
    }
}
```

> **Important**: Replace `YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_BEARER_TOKEN` with your actual Hugging Face token for full functionality.

## Building the Paper Management System

### Paper Manager (`paper_manager.py`)

The paper manager provides a clean interface for managing research data using JSON storage:

#### Core Architecture

```python
class PaperManager:
    """Paper manager that handles research tracking and data storage."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_dir = Path("data")
        self.papers_file = self.data_dir / "research_papers.json"
    
    def add_research_entry(self, topic: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Add a new research entry for a topic."""
        research_entry = {
            "id": len(papers) + 1,
            "topic": topic,
            "created": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "status": "pending",
            "papers_found": [],
            "repositories_found": [],
            "notes": ""
        }
        return research_entry
```

#### Key Features

- **JSON Storage**: Human-readable data format that's easy to inspect and modify
- **Research Entries**: Structured tracking of research topics with unique IDs
- **Paper and Repository Management**: Add papers and repositories to research entries with timestamps
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor research progress from pending to active to complete
- **Search Functionality**: Search across research entries, papers, and repositories
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update functionality for research management

> **📁 Full Implementation**: See `AIResearchHub/paper_manager.py` for the complete implementation with all methods.

## MCP Server Implementation

### Main Server (`server.py`)

The server demonstrates how to create complementary tools that work together in a research workflow:

#### Server Architecture

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from paper_manager import PaperManager

mcp = FastMCP("AI Research Hub")
paper_manager = PaperManager()
```

#### Core Tools: Complete Research Management

**Tool 1: Research Entry Creation**

```python
@mcp.tool(description="Start researching a topic and get research ID")
async def research_topic(topic: str) -> dict:
    """Create research entry and provide research ID."""
```

This tool:

- Creates a structured research entry in the local database
- Returns a unique research ID for tracking
- Reports the total number of research topics
- Focuses solely on what it accomplished

**Tool 2: GitHub Search Strategy**

```python
@mcp.tool(description="Get GitHub search strategies for finding implementations")
async def get_github_searches(topic: str) -> dict:
    """Generate GitHub search strategies for finding code implementations."""
```

This tool:

- Generates multiple targeted search variations
- Provides specific GitHub MCP commands with quality filters
- Includes star count filters and language specifications
- Returns actionable search strategies

**Tool 3: Paper Management**

```python
@mcp.tool(description="Add a paper to a research entry")
async def add_paper(research_id: int, title: str, authors: str = "", url: str = "") -> dict:
    """Add a research paper to an existing research entry."""
```

**Tool 4: Repository Management**

```python
@mcp.tool(description="Add a repository to a research entry")
async def add_repository(research_id: int, name: str, url: str = "", stars: int = 0) -> dict:
    """Add a code repository to an existing research entry."""
```

**Tool 5: Research Search**

```python
@mcp.tool(description="Search local research database")
async def search_research(query: str) -> dict:
    """Search your local research database for matching content."""
```

**Tool 6: Status Management**

```python
@mcp.tool(description="Update research status and add notes")
async def update_research_status(research_id: int, status: str, notes: str = "") -> dict:
    """Update the status of a research entry."""
```

#### Guided Research Workflow

**Research Prompt** - Orchestrates the complete workflow:

```python
@mcp.prompt(name="research_workflow")
def research_workflow_prompt(topic: str) -> str:
    """Complete research workflow for any topic."""
```

The workflow provides:

1. Step-by-step instructions using all tools
2. Integration points with external MCP servers
3. Clear guidance for organizing findings
4. Focus areas for analysis and summary

#### Resource: Research Dashboard

**Comprehensive Status Resource**:

```python
@mcp.resource("status://dashboard")
def research_status() -> str:
    """Current research status and saved topics."""
```

Provides:

- Complete research activity overview
- Active vs pending research counts
- Detailed entries with timestamps
- Database statistics and health information

> **📁 Full Implementation**: See `AIResearchHub/server.py` for the complete server with all tools, prompts, and resources.

3. **Execute External Searches**: Run HuggingFace and GitHub MCP with provided strategies
4. **Save Findings**: Use `add_paper()` and `add_repository()` to store discoveries
5. **Monitor Progress**: Check `status://dashboard` for your complete research history
6. **Update Status**: Use `update_research_status()` to mark completion and add notes

### Example Tool Responses

**research_topic("neural networks") returns:**

```json
